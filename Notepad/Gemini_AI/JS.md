## 30 Day JavaScript Learning Schedule (Beginner to Intermediate)

**While reaching "advanced" in 30 days is ambitious, this plan will give you a strong foundation and set you on the path for further learning.**

**General Approach:**

* Each day will focus on a core concept with explanations and examples.
* Practice is crucial! Do the exercises and build small projects to solidify your understanding.
* There are many online resources; I'll recommend some but feel free to explore others!

**Days 1-5:  JavaScript Basics**

* **Day 1:** Introduction to JavaScript, console interaction, basic syntax (variables, data types - numbers, strings, booleans)
* **Day 2:** Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical), control flow (if/else statements, loops - for, while)
* **Day 3:** Functions (declaring, calling, arguments, return values)
* **Day 4:** Arrays (declaring, accessing elements, iteration), Objects (key-value pairs, accessing properties)
* **Day 5:** Practice! Build a simple calculator or quiz using concepts learned so far.

**Days 6-10:  Going Deeper**

* **Day 6:** Strings in detail (methods like split, join, substring)
* **Day 7:**  Functions in detail (function scope, parameters, arrow functions)
* **Day 8:**  Error handling (try/catch blocks) and debugging techniques
* **Day 9:**  Dates and Times (working with dates and times in JavaScript)
* **Day 10:** Project - Build a simple to-do list application using local storage to persist data.
* **Resources:**  MDN JavaScript documentation ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript))

**Days 11-15:  DOM Manipulation**

* **Day 11:** Introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM)
* **Day 12:** Selecting elements (getElementById, querySelector), manipulating styles and attributes
* **Day 13:** Events (click, mouseover, keypress) and event listeners
* **Day 14:**  Building interactive elements - forms and validation
* **Day 15:** Project -  Build a simple weather app that fetches data from an API. (Focus on fetching and displaying data using APIs)
* **Resources:** [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp), [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

**Days 16-20:  Advanced Topics (Introduction)**

* **Day 16:**  Introduction to Asynchronous Programming (callbacks, promises)
* **Day 17:**  Error handling and debugging in asynchronous code
* **Day 18:**  Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance)
* **Day 19:**  Modules and Import/Export in JavaScript (using modules to organize code)
* **Day 20:** Project - Build a small game (text-based or simple graphics) using object-oriented principles.
* **Resources:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class), [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) 

**Days 21-25:  Exploring Frameworks (Optional)**

* **Day 21:** Introduction to a popular JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) - basic concepts and structure
* **Day 22-24:** Learn core functionalities of the chosen framework (components, state management)
* **Day 25:**  Project - Build a simple single-page application (SPA) using the chosen framework.
* **Resources:**  Choose tutorials or documentation for your preferred framework (React - [https://react.dev/](https://react.dev/), Vue.js - [https://vuejs.org/](https://vuejs.org/))

**Days 26-30:  Deepen Your Knowledge**

* **Day 26-28:**  Explore advanced topics based on your interests (e.g., DOM manipulation libraries, testing frameworks)
* **Day 29:**  Review and solidify your understanding. Identify areas for further improvement.
* **Day 30:**  Plan your next steps! Explore advanced libraries, contribute to open-source projects, build a portfolio.

**Remember:** Consistency is key! Practice daily, experiment with code, and don't be afraid to ask questions in online forums or communities.
