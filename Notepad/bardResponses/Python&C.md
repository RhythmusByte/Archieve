**Week 7 (Focus: Practice & Review):**

* **Goals:**  Consolidate learnings, practice problem-solving with projects in both languages. 
* **Projects:**  Choose a project that interests you and implement it in either Python or C (e.g., a simple to-do list app, a quiz game). 
* **Resources:**
    *  Search for online coding challenges for both Python and C ([https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/) or [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/))

**Remember:**

* This is a suggested schedule, adjust the pace based on your progress. 
* Focus on understanding concepts, not just memorizing syntax.
* Practice consistently by solving coding problems online or from books.
* Don't hesitate to seek help from online communities or forums.
* Learning to program takes time and dedication. Celebrate small wins and be persistent!
